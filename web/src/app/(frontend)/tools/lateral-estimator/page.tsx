  {
    question: "How much does a fiber lateral cost per foot or per mile?",
    answer:
      "Per the Fiber Broadband Association's 2025 Deployment Cost Report, underground fiber construction runs a median of $18 per foot — roughly $95,000 per mile — versus a median of $8 per foot for aerial construction, or about $42,000 per mile. A mixed build blends the two based on the share of route that runs underground versus aerial. These are national medians: your actual cost depends on terrain, permitting, and make-ready work at the specific route, which is why any real quote requires route engineering, not a per-mile multiplier.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a fiber lateral take to build?",
    answer:
      "Budget three phases: design (1–3 months), permitting (3–6 months, longer on federal or tribal land), and construction (3–12 months depending on distance). A lateral under a mile can land in as little as 7 months start to finish; a lateral over five miles commonly runs 14–21 months once permitting and multi-segment construction are accounted for. Order the lateral early — permitting and outside-plant construction routinely run longer than the network equipment lead time.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes fiber lateral costs vary so much?",
    answer:
      "Five factors dominate the variance: make-ready work (existing pole or conduit conditions), railroad and highway crossings (bore permits, flagging, insurance requirements), environmental review, tribal or federal land permitting (NEPA, Section 106, tribal right-of-way consent), and right-of-way (ROW) negotiations with private landowners or municipalities. Any one of these can add months and materially change the cost — which is why published medians only describe the starting point, not the number a specific route will actually cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "When should I order the fiber lateral for a data center project?",
    answer:
      "At site selection, not at commissioning. Fiber proximity should be a go/no-go screen alongside power, because a five-mile lateral can add millions to a project and kill its economics before ground breaks. Once a site is chosen, order the lateral during construction — permitting and outside-plant construction commonly run 6 to 18 months and must land before the ready-for-service date. Teams that wait until commissioning to start connectivity are the ones who discover a multimillion-dollar lateral after construction milestones are already locked.",
