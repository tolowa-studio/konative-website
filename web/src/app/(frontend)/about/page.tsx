  {
    question: "Is Konative really a Native-owned business?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Konative is founded and majority-owned by Jeramey James, an enrolled citizen of the Tolowa Dee-ni' Nation. Native ownership is a matter of fact about who owns and controls the firm — not a marketing label.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Native ownership matter for our procurement?",
    answer:
      "It often does. Many Tribal nations, tribal enterprises, and federally funded programs extend procurement preference to Native-owned businesses, and many Tribes prefer to keep dollars inside Indian Country. Eligibility rules vary by program, so confirm the specifics with your procurement office — but Konative qualifies as a Native-owned vendor.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Konative a certified Minority/Native-Owned Business Enterprise?",
    answer:
      "Konative is Native-owned by ownership fact today; formal certification (for example SBA 8(a), NMSDC MBE, a state DBE/MBE, or tribal TERO status) is a separate credentialing step we can pursue where a specific program requires it. We will never claim a certification we do not hold.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does a Native-owned broker serve Tribal enterprises better?",
    answer:
      "Sovereignty-first is our default, not an accommodation. We understand tribal governance, procurement, and the difference between a grant-funded build and an operating network — because we have lived it. A vendor-neutral broker that shares that context represents the Tribe's interest, not a carrier's.",
