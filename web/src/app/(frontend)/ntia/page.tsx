      "The NTIA Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) Round 3, combined with the Native Entities Grant Program (NEGP), makes approximately $790 million available for Tribal broadband. The application window is open now and closes September 17, 2026, with awards expected on a rolling basis beginning Spring 2027.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is eligible to apply?",

      "Eligible applicants include Tribal governments, Tribal colleges and universities, Tribal organizations, Alaska Native Corporations, and Native Hawaiian organizations (DHHL). This is a sovereignty-aligned program directed to Native entities.",
  },
  {
    question: "If the grant funds the infrastructure, what does Konative actually do?",
    answer:
      "Federal grants fund infrastructure — fiber, middle-mile, last-mile, and power. They do not fund the operational connectivity layer that runs on top of it: the enterprise internet, SD-WAN, voice, cybersecurity, redundancy, and cloud on-ramps that keep a gaming floor, clinic, government office, or school running. That recurring operational layer is what Konative sources, designs, and manages.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does Konative cost a Tribe or Native entity?",
    answer:
      "Nothing. Konative is a vendor-neutral connectivity brokerage operating as a subagent under Avant Communications. Suppliers pay our commission, so the Tribe gets an expert, carrier-neutral advisor and a single point of contact across every carrier at no cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "We haven't been awarded yet. Is it too early to engage Konative?",
    answer:
      "No — pre-award is the right time. Engaging before the September 17, 2026 deadline lets us specify carrier-grade operational connectivity into your proposal and pre-negotiate carrier terms, so the connectivity is ready to execute the moment funding lands in Spring 2027 rather than restarted from scratch.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Konative really vendor-neutral?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Konative is not a carrier. We source across Avant's portfolio of 100+ suppliers and recommend what fits your requirement, not what pays us most. On low-density Tribal lands, that neutrality — including fixed wireless and satellite where fiber doesn't reach — is what makes a workable route possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a Round 3 award come with a specific connectivity contract, or does Konative sign anything on our behalf?",
    answer:
      "Neither the grant nor Konative puts the Tribe into a connectivity contract automatically. NTIA's award funds the infrastructure build; the operational connectivity contract — internet, SD-WAN, voice, security — is a separate agreement between the Tribe (or Tribal entity) and the winning carrier once that carrier is selected. Konative runs the sourcing and negotiation process and stays engaged through the life of the contract, but the Tribe contracts directly with the carrier. Pre-negotiating those terms during the pre-award window is what lets execution happen quickly once funding is confirmed, rather than starting the carrier search from scratch in Spring 2027.",
