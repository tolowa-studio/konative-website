    question: "What are TBCP 3 and NEGP?",
    answer:
      "TBCP 3 is the 2026 round of NTIA's Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program. NEGP is the Native Entities Grant Program, the Native entity set-aside under the Digital Equity Act. Together, the 2026 funding lane is intended to support broadband connectivity, infrastructure availability, adoption, and related activities for Tribal and Native communities. Konative is not NTIA and does not administer grant awards.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can Konative help with TBCP 3 or NEGP?",
    answer:
      "Konative helps Tribal teams translate funding intent into carrier-ready connectivity requirements: locations, bandwidth, fiber or transport needs, SD-WAN, voice, cloud connectivity, managed security, resilience, service dates, supplier comparisons, and quote-to-install coordination. We do not replace grant counsel, engineering, or NTIA program guidance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Konative charge Tribal nations for brokerage help?",
    answer:
      "No. Konative's brokerage compensation is paid by the supplier that wins the business. Tribal buyers can use Konative to compare the supplier market at no cost and with no obligation to purchase.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should we talk to Konative before or after applying?",
    answer:
      "Both can be useful. Before applying, Konative can help clarify service requirements and commercial assumptions. After an award or during procurement, Konative can help compare carrier options, resilience designs, service terms, and implementation paths.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Konative write the grant application?",
    answer:
      "Konative is not positioned as a grant-writing firm. We can support the connectivity and supplier-market side of the plan, and we can collaborate with a Tribe's grant writer, engineer, counsel, ISP partner, or broadband consultant.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should a Tribal team prepare before contacting Konative?",
    answer:
      "Helpful inputs include target service areas, facilities, current circuits or vendors, known bandwidth needs, funding program context, procurement constraints, required service dates, resilience requirements, and any existing engineering or grant materials.",

                A broadband funding opportunity creates urgency, but the hard work is translating that opportunity
                into a buildable and operable network plan. Tribal teams still need to define service areas,
                facilities, transport paths, bandwidth, resilience, security, procurement rules, and supplier options.
