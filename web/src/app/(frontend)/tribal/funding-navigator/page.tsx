    question: "What is due September 17, 2026?",
    answer:
      "Applications for both NTIA funding opportunities opened June 17, 2026: Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) Round 3 ($540 million) and the Native Entities Grant Program (NEGP, $250 million). Both close September 17, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET, submitted through the NTIA grants portal. Awards are expected on a rolling basis beginning Spring 2027.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between TBCP Round 3 and the NEGP?",
    answer:
      "TBCP Round 3 is the larger program ($540M, run by NTIA BroadbandUSA) and funds both broadband infrastructure deployment and broadband use and adoption projects — including affordability subsidies, devices, digital skills, telehealth, and distance learning. The NEGP ($250M, under the Digital Equity Act) makes smaller grants of $500,000 to $2.5 million for Native entities' digital equity and inclusion activities, with a 10% match that can be waived. If you are building network infrastructure, TBCP Round 3 is the fit; if you are running a focused digital-equity program, NEGP may be the faster path.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we apply to both programs?",
    answer:
      "Both opportunities are open simultaneously with the same September 17, 2026 deadline, and many Tribal Nations have needs that map to each — infrastructure under TBCP Round 3 and digital-equity programming under NEGP. Read both NOFOs carefully for scope and duplication-of-funding rules, and confirm your application strategy with your NTIA program officer. Splitting a coherent story across two sharp applications is usually stronger than stretching one application to cover everything.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if we miss the September 17 deadline?",
    answer:
      "There is no announced extension, so treat September 17, 2026 at 11:59 p.m. ET as hard. If the window closes without an application, the practical next moves are: pursue FY2026 E-Rate for eligible anchor institutions (the Tribal library Category Two floor is now $66,385 with a 90% maximum discount, and the FCC's T-LEAP program offers free application help), watch for future federal windows, and get procurement-ready now so the next opportunity is not a scramble. Konative can help you scope requirements either way.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Konative charge for this navigator or for application-window help?",
    answer:
      "No. This page is free with no signup, and a working session during the application window costs nothing. Konative is a vendor-neutral connectivity brokerage paid by suppliers when they win business — not by Tribes, and never from grant funds. We do not write grants and no federal money flows through us.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after awards are announced?",
    answer:
      "NTIA expects to make awards on a rolling basis beginning Spring 2027. Funded projects then move into procurement and build: selecting carriers, pricing circuits and transport, and executing the network the application promised. That post-award phase is where a broker earns its keep — making carriers compete on the build and the ongoing connectivity instead of accepting the first quote.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does a connectivity broker fit alongside our grant writer?",
    answer:
      "They are different jobs on the same application. Your grant writer owns the narrative, compliance, and submission. Konative pressure-tests the technical and commercial side: is the network scoped realistically, are the carrier costs in the budget defensible, and can the promised service levels actually be procured in your service area? We work alongside grant writers and Native-owned advisors such as AMERIND Critical Infrastructure, Tribal Ready, and MuralNet — partners, not competitors.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is an affordability subsidy really an eligible use of TBCP funds?",
    answer:
      "Yes. TBCP Round 3 program materials list broadband use and adoption projects as eligible alongside infrastructure deployment — including affordability subsidies for free or reduced-cost service, devices, digital skills training, telehealth, and distance learning. With the Affordable Connectivity Program gone, this is one of the few federal paths to directly lowering household broadband costs on Tribal lands. Confirm the specifics against the TBCP Round 3 NOFO.",
