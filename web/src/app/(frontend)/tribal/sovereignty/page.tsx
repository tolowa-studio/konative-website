  {
    question: "Who signs the carrier contracts — Konative or the Tribe?",
    answer:
      "The Tribe or tribal enterprise, always. Every carrier agreement is between the carrier and your organization. Konative acts as agent-of-record working on your behalf — we negotiate and manage the relationship, but we are never a party that sits between you and your network. If Konative disappeared tomorrow, every contract, every circuit, and every service would still be yours.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Konative actually get paid?",
    answer:
      "Suppliers pay us a commission when they win your business — typically 15 to 20 percent of monthly recurring charges, which is the industry-standard technology brokerage model. You pay us nothing: no advisory fee, no retainer, no percentage of anything. And we will disclose our commission on any specific deal — just ask.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens to our data if we stop working with Konative?",
    answer:
      "Nothing changes, because it was yours all along. Network documentation, quotes, and inventory live in your systems; we keep copies only with your permission. Data sovereignty means your data stays under your jurisdiction — ending the relationship doesn't require an export, a handover negotiation, or a request. You already have everything.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Konative take a percentage of grant awards or charge for funding help?",
    answer:
      "No. We don't grant-farm: we don't take percentages of awards, we don't write grants for fees, and federal money never touches our hands. Our funding-window help — like the free TBCP Round 3 and NEGP navigator — costs nothing. We benefit only if, once you're funded, you choose to run your carrier procurement through us, and even then the suppliers pay us, not you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you compete with Native-owned organizations like AMERIND or Tribal Ready?",
    answer:
      "No — we work alongside them. AMERIND Critical Infrastructure, Tribal Ready, MuralNet, and tribally-owned telecoms like NTUA cover funding strategy, network builds, advocacy, and operations. Konative's lane is multi-carrier procurement and lifecycle management: making the carrier market compete for your business and managing those services over time. Different jobs, same team, and the Tribe gets the whole stack.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'no lock-in' mean in practice?",
    answer:
      "No exclusivity clause, no minimum term on our relationship, and no termination fee — ever. If we stop being useful, fire us and keep everything: the contracts (they're already in your name), the documentation (it's already in your systems), and the carrier relationships. The only thing that ends is our involvement.",

            2026 federal False Claims Act suit over $2.1 million in alleged fraudulent billing
