    question: "How is this free?",
    answer:
      "Konative is paid by the supplier that wins the business, not by the Tribal buyer. That's the standard technology brokerage model, and it holds here too: the coverage report is yours regardless of whether you ever engage us for procurement. No advisory fee, no retainer, no obligation to purchase.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does the report include?",
    answer:
      "A written breakdown of which carriers and regional or tribal-friendly providers can actually serve your location and sites — both wholesale and retail options — sourced across a 100+ supplier portfolio. Where relevant, we include wholesale transport options, benchmark context on what comparable buyers pay, and plain documentation of any redlining: carriers who claim coverage on paper but can't actually deliver a working circuit. That documentation is useful on its own, including for funding applications that require serviceability evidence.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you know better than the FCC map?",
    answer:
      "We don't replace it — we go further than it can. The FCC National Broadband Map is a genuinely useful starting point, but it's built from carrier self-reported data, and on tribal lands that data is frequently overstated: a carrier reports an area as served when in practice they can't or won't turn up a real circuit there. We contact carriers and regional providers directly, ask the specific serviceability question for your specific sites, and document what they actually say — not what they filed with the FCC.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you serve Alaska Native villages and Canadian First Nations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our carrier and supplier portfolio spans the US and Canada, and we work with Alaska Native villages and First Nations communities alongside lower-48 tribal nations and enterprises. Serviceability and available providers vary a lot by region, which is exactly why a location-specific report is more useful than a general map.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after the report?",
    answer:
      "Nothing, unless you want something to happen. You get the written report either way. If you want to move forward, we run a competitive quoting process across the carriers who can actually serve you, compare wholesale and retail terms, and manage the path through installation — still at no cost to you, since suppliers pay our fee.",

            Carrier coverage claims on tribal lands are notoriously unreliable — a map says
            a provider serves your area, and the provider says otherwise the moment you call.
            A two-person tribal IT shop shouldn&apos;t have to chase fifteen carriers for a
            straight answer. Tell us your location and sites; within 48 hours we deliver a
            written report of which carriers and regional providers can actually serve
            you — wholesale and retail — sourced across a 100+ supplier portfolio.

            Honest caveat: the map is built from carrier-reported data, and on tribal lands
            that data frequently overstates real availability. A provider can show as
