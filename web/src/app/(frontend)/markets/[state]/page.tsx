    headline: 'THE DATA CENTER CAPITAL OF THE WORLD',
    subheadline: 'Northern Virginia hosts more data center capacity than any other market on Earth. Power is the constraint.',
    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'Northern Virginia has the densest metro dark-fiber footprint in North America, alongside Silicon Valley, Chicago, and Dallas — but density has created its own bottleneck. Routes into Ashburn and the Data Center Alley corridor are congested, with construction crews, conduit space, and carrier capacity all under pressure from the sheer volume of concurrent builds. New entrants should expect real competition for dig windows and route access even where fiber already exists nearby.',

    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'Dallas remains one of the four markets with the deepest concentration of metro dark fiber in North America, giving it a mature, multi-carrier bench for laterals and long-haul transport. San Antonio is rising fast as a secondary hub behind Dallas, drawing overflow demand and new hyperscale investment, but its regional carrier density is still catching up — buyers there should expect a smaller supplier bench and plan lateral routes earlier than they would in Dallas proper.',

    headline: 'THE SOUTHEAST CORRIDOR',
    subheadline: 'Atlanta is the connectivity hub of the Southeast. Georgia Power and TVA territory with strong incentive programs.',
    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'Atlanta anchors network connectivity for the entire Southeast, with a mature carrier-neutral colocation base and multiple long-haul routes converging on the metro. Regional fiber options thin out quickly outside the Atlanta core, so sites elsewhere in Georgia Power or TVA territory should budget for longer laterals and confirm carrier serviceability early rather than assuming Atlanta-level density extends statewide.',

    tier: 'emerging',
    fiberBrief: 'West Michigan\'s hyperscaler footprint is still young relative to its power and cooling advantages, and regional carrier density reflects that — fiber options are workable but not deep, with most long-haul routes running through larger Midwest hubs rather than terminating locally. Buyers should scope laterals with a regional carrier early and treat construction lead time as a first-order planning input rather than an afterthought.',

    tier: 'emerging',
    fiberBrief: 'Phoenix has built out a genuine carrier-neutral colocation base over the past decade, and long-haul routes connecting it to Los Angeles and Dallas give it reasonable transport diversity for a Western secondary market. Even so, the pace of new campus announcements is outrunning regional fiber buildout in outlying areas, so sites outside the core Phoenix metro should plan for longer construction timelines on laterals.',

    headline: 'THE MIDWEST INFRASTRUCTURE CORRIDOR',
    subheadline: 'Columbus and central Ohio emerging as the next major data center cluster. Strong PJM grid access.',
    tier: 'emerging',
    fiberBrief: 'Columbus is one of the clearest 2026 deal-activity leaders in the country, but its regional fiber density has not kept pace with the capital flowing in — metro dark fiber remains concentrated in Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Chicago, and Dallas, not central Ohio. That gap means buyers here face a thinner carrier bench and should expect fiber cable lead times of 20 weeks to a year to shape site-selection and construction schedules directly.',

    iso: 'PJM', isoFull: 'PJM Interconnection',
    headline: 'CHICAGO: THE NETWORK CROSSROADS',
    subheadline: 'Chicago is one of the densest network peering hubs in North America. Critical for latency-sensitive deployments.',
    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'Chicago is one of the four markets with the deepest concentration of metro dark fiber in North America, and its carrier-hotel and peering infrastructure make it a true crossroads for long-haul routes running east-west and north-south. That density gives buyers unusually strong route-diversity options and a large supplier bench — Chicago is typically the easiest of the secondary-adjacent Midwest markets to source competitively.',

    subheadline: 'Affordable hydro power and a long history of hyperscaler investment along the Columbia River corridor.',
    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'The Columbia River corridor has a long operating history with hyperscale tenants, which has built out a genuinely mature regional carrier base along with the power infrastructure. That maturity gives Oregon sites an easier path to carrier diversity than most emerging markets, though buyers moving away from the established corridor toward newer sites should still confirm serviceability rather than assume corridor-wide density.',

    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'The I-90 and I-5 fiber spine gives the Seattle metro genuine carrier density, but the real story in 2026 is Central Washington emerging as a tertiary wave market alongside Iowa and Kansas City — new capacity is landing well outside the traditional corridor. Sites in Central Washington should expect materially thinner regional fiber options than Seattle and plan laterals with the assumption that construction, not just carrier selection, is on the critical path.',

    subheadline: 'Toronto and the Golden Horseshoe are Canada\'s leading digital infrastructure markets with strong grid access.',
    tier: 'primary',
    fiberBrief: 'Toronto is Canada\'s clearest analog to a primary US fiber market — carrier-neutral colocation, a deep peering ecosystem, and long-haul routes connecting to both the US Midwest and Quebec give the Golden Horseshoe genuine route diversity. Buyers here typically face the most competitive supplier bench of any Canadian market, though cross-border transport terms still need to be scoped carefully alongside domestic options.',

    tier: 'emerging',
    fiberBrief: 'Montreal is anchoring one of the largest announced AI infrastructure commitments in Canada — Bell\'s 500 MW AI Fabric project — which is pulling new long-haul and metro fiber investment into the corridor ahead of demand. That means the carrier landscape is shifting quickly: buyers evaluating Montreal-area sites now should expect the supplier bench to look meaningfully different — and denser — within the next 12-24 months as that build-out matures.',

    subheadline: 'The only Canadian market where you can credibly co-locate generation with load. 30+ AI DC projects in the AESO queue. Calgary metro is the gravity center.',
    tier: 'emerging',
    fiberBrief: 'Alberta is the frontier of Canadian AI data-center development, with Calgary as the gravity center and the Wonder Valley project signaling the scale of what\'s coming. Fiber infrastructure is still catching up to the 30+ AI DC projects in the AESO interconnection queue — this is a market where connectivity should be scoped alongside power and land from day one, not treated as a later-stage checklist item, given how far ahead of regional fiber build-out the project queue currently runs.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'With new DC interconnections capped in 2026, BC\'s connectivity story is tightly coupled to where the limited available capacity actually lands — largely through First Nations partnership sites unlocked alongside Site C. Regional fiber options should be evaluated site-by-site rather than assumed at a provincial level, since the constrained interconnection landscape means viable locations are the exception, not the rule.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'Regina and Saskatoon carry the province\'s existing telecom DC infrastructure, but Bell\'s 300 MW AI campus and the George Gordon First Nation partnership represent a genuinely new tier of connectivity demand for the province. Regional fiber capacity built for telecom-scale workloads will need real augmentation to serve AI-scale campuses — buyers should treat this as a build-ahead market rather than one with existing spare dark-fiber capacity.',

    subheadline: 'Bell\'s Winnipeg food-plant-to-AI conversion and Cerebras\' announced Manitoba campus put Winnipeg on the sovereign compute map.',
    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'Winnipeg\'s emergence as a sovereign-compute site — via Bell\'s conversion project and the announced Cerebras campus — is a conversion story more than an organic build-out, which means fiber connectivity is being retrofitted to a facility that wasn\'t originally designed for AI-scale bandwidth. Buyers should confirm actual carrier serviceability and route diversity at the specific site rather than assuming Winnipeg\'s telecom-era infrastructure is sufficient as-is.',

    headline: 'ATLANTIC CONNECTIVITY',
    subheadline: 'Halifax anchors Atlantic telecom and colocation — smaller scale but strategic for east-coast latency.',
    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'Halifax\'s role as an Atlantic telecom and colocation anchor gives it useful subsea and east-coast latency positioning, but the market is small-scale relative to central Canada. Regional fiber options are workable for the telecom and enterprise colocation loads the market actually serves today; larger AI-scale deployments would need a dedicated serviceability check before assuming that infrastructure scales up cleanly.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'The Moncton/Saint John corridor benefits from Equinix SJ1 and Bell Moncton\'s existing peering and colocation infrastructure, giving the province a credible regional fiber base for enterprise-scale workloads. That infrastructure was built for regional peering, not hyperscale AI capacity, so larger deployments should confirm route diversity and available strand capacity rather than assume headroom.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'St. John\'s functions primarily as a telecom node with limited colocation footprint, so regional fiber options are built around carrier and enterprise DC needs rather than hyperscale capacity. Any larger deployment here should start with a direct serviceability check rather than assuming density comparable to a mainland secondary market.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'PEI\'s single provincial telecom hub structure means fiber options are limited by design — this is an edge-use-case market, not a candidate for large-scale interconnection or dark-fiber sourcing. Buyers evaluating PEI should scope for niche, latency-specific use cases and confirm the single-hub topology meets resilience requirements before committing.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'Yellowknife\'s Northwestel hub offers a real cooling advantage for edge deployments, but fiber connectivity into the territory is limited and long-haul routes are correspondingly scarce. This is a market where lateral construction and route diversity should be treated as the primary constraint, ahead of power, given how thin the existing telecom backbone is relative to southern Canadian markets.',

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'With no major colocation or hyperscale footprint tracked yet, Yukon\'s fiber infrastructure remains built for basic regional telecom needs rather than data-center-scale connectivity.

    tier: 'developing',
    fiberBrief: 'Nunavut has no tracked data-center fiber inventory today, and terrestrial long-haul options are genuinely scarce given the territory\'s geography. Any future Arctic-edge or sovereign-compute pilot here would need a dedicated connectivity feasibility study from scratch — there is no existing carrier bench to source against.',

    fiberBrief: 'Querétaro\'s existing fiber spine — built up alongside its nearshore manufacturing base — gives it a genuine head start over most emerging Latin American markets, with reasonable route diversity toward Mexico City and the US border. Growing hyperscaler interest is now testing the limits of that legacy infrastructure, so buyers should confirm current carrier capacity rather than assume the spine was sized for data-center-scale bandwidth from the start.',

    fiberBrief: 'Salt Lake City is one of 2026\'s top deal-activity markets, but carrier density has not caught up to demand — metro dark fiber remains concentrated in Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Chicago, and Dallas, not the Mountain West. Buyers here should expect thinner regional fiber options and longer lateral distances than legacy hubs.
