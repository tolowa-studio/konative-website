  {
    question: "What is a connectivity broker?",
    answer:
      "A connectivity broker is a vendor-neutral intermediary who represents the buyer — not any single carrier. The broker solicits quotes from multiple suppliers, compares commercial terms, designs the right solution, and stays involved through provisioning and renewal. Because suppliers pay the broker's fee, there is no cost to the buyer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does Konative broker?",
    answer:
      "Konative brokers the full connectivity stack: dedicated internet access (DIA), lit and dark fiber, wavelengths and transport, SD-WAN, UCaaS and CCaaS, cloud on-ramps (AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, Google Interconnect), SASE and managed security, fixed wireless and mobility, colocation, and data-center interconnection. All sourced through Avant's portfolio of 100+ suppliers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why use a broker instead of going directly to a carrier?",
    answer:
      "A single carrier can only quote its own network. A broker quotes the whole market, identifies supplier constraints before they become delivery problems, normalizes pricing so terms are truly comparable, and holds the supplier accountable through installation. Because suppliers compete for the business, buyers typically see better pricing and terms than they would negotiating alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Konative cost anything?",
    answer:
      "No. Konative is paid by the supplier that wins the business, not by the buyer. This is the standard technology brokerage model — the same way travel agents and insurance brokers operate. There is no advisory fee, no retainer, and no obligation to purchase.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Avant and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Avant is North America's largest technology services distributor. As an Avant sub-agent, Konative has access to Avant's portfolio of 100+ carriers and cloud providers, enabling us to compare real quotes from the whole market rather than the two or three suppliers any single agent typically carries.", /* VERIFY: "100+" supplier count is the public Avant portfolio figure — verify current number at avant.com */
  },
  {
    question: "What types of organizations does Konative serve?",
    answer:
      "Konative serves two primary markets: (1) Tribal enterprises — gaming, government, healthcare, education, and other Tribal businesses that need carrier-grade connectivity with a sovereignty-aware advisor — and (2) data center developers, operators, and AI infrastructure teams that need transport, dark fiber, interconnection, and cloud on-ramps. Konative also serves rural and multi-site enterprises in underserved markets.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the process work?",
    answer:
      "Konative starts with a requirements brief covering locations, bandwidth, resilience needs, and timeline. We then run the supplier market, collect quotes, and present a normalized comparison. After selection, we manage the order through provisioning and installation, then stay in the account for renewals and lifecycle support — one point of contact for the life of the service.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between /tribal and /data-center-connectivity?",
    answer:
      "Both are connectivity brokerage services, just optimized for different buyers. The Tribal page (/tribal) is focused on Tribal enterprises, sovereignty-aware procurement, and federally funded broadband projects. The data-center connectivity page (/data-center-connectivity) is focused on the network layer into data center facilities — transport, dark fiber, cross-connects, cloud on-ramps, and interconnection for developers and operators.",
