  {
    question: "What is a data center connectivity broker?",
    answer:
      "A data-center connectivity broker is a vendor-neutral intermediary who represents the facility owner or developer — not any single carrier. The broker surveys the market for transport, dark fiber, cross-connects, and cloud on-ramps, compares commercial terms across multiple suppliers, designs diverse and redundant routes, and manages the order through installation. Because suppliers pay the broker's fee, there is no cost to the buyer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What connectivity does Konative broker for data centers?",
    answer:
      "Konative brokers the full network layer into and between data-center facilities: long-haul and metro transport, lit and dark fiber, 10G/100G/400G wavelengths, data-center interconnection (DCI), cross-connects and carrier-neutral colocation, cloud on-ramps (AWS Direct Connect, Azure ExpressRoute, Google Interconnect, Oracle FastConnect), diverse internet access, and managed security. All sourced through Avant's portfolio of 100+ suppliers.", // VERIFY: "100+" supplier count — verify current number at avant.com
  },
  {
    question: "Why use a broker instead of going directly to a carrier?",
    answer:
      "A single carrier can only quote its own network. A broker quotes the whole market, identifies serviceability and construction exposure before they become delivery problems, normalizes pricing so terms are truly comparable, and holds the supplier accountable through provisioning. Because suppliers compete for the business, buyers typically see better pricing and faster timelines than they would negotiating alone.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Konative cost anything?",
    answer:
      "No. Konative is paid by the supplier that wins the business, not by the buyer. This is the standard technology brokerage model. There is no advisory fee, no retainer, and no obligation to purchase.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information do you need to start a connectivity sourcing engagement?",
    answer:
      "Konative starts with four inputs: (1) site address and development stage, (2) capacity profile — initial and ultimate bandwidth, transport, wavelength, and cloud requirements, (3) physical resilience requirements — carrier diversity, route diversity, building entrances, and failover assumptions, and (4) commercial milestones — ready-for-service date and contract structure preferences. From there we run the supplier market and return a normalized comparison.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Avant and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Avant is North America's largest technology services distributor. As an Avant sub-agent, Konative has access to Avant's portfolio of 100+ carriers and cloud providers, enabling us to compare real quotes from the whole market rather than the two or three suppliers any single agent typically carries.", // VERIFY: "100+" supplier count — verify current number at avant.com
  },
  {
    question: "Do you still help with powered land or site selection?",
    answer:
      "Yes — site and land buyers are a natural fit. If you are evaluating a site or securing powered land for a data center campus, connectivity is typically the next constraint after power. Konative can run a connectivity feasibility check alongside your land and power work, so you understand carrier availability, diversity options, and construction exposure before you commit to a site.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help with a site that is still in development or pre-construction?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Early engagement is better — carrier serviceability, route diversity, and construction lead times can affect site selection decisions. Konative can assess connectivity feasibility at the address or parcel level and give you a frank picture of what exists, what needs to be built, and what that costs before you are locked into a location.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who holds the contract — Konative or the carrier?",
    answer:
      "The carrier does. Konative runs the sourcing process — collecting bids, comparing serviceability and pricing across suppliers, and negotiating terms — but the facility owner or developer signs directly with the winning carrier. Konative is not a party to that agreement and does not take on carrier service-delivery liability. What Konative does take on is the ongoing relationship: staying in the account after signing to manage installation, escalations, and renewals.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens after installation if there's an outage or a service issue?",
    answer:
      "Call Konative first. Post-installation, Konative remains the single point of contact across every carrier in your stack — that includes outage escalation, billing disputes, and moves/adds/changes. Rather than you managing a separate support relationship with each carrier, Konative works the escalation on your behalf and keeps pressure on the SLA. This ongoing role is part of the brokerage relationship, not a separate paid service.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a fiber lateral cost?",
    answer:
      "Per the Fiber Broadband Association's 2025 Deployment Cost Report, underground fiber construction runs a median of $18 per foot — roughly $95,000 per mile — versus a median of $8 per foot for aerial. Distance and terrain dominate the math: a short lateral across a business park and a five-mile bore under a highway are entirely different projects. That is why Konative scopes laterals parcel-by-parcel, using real construction quotes from the suppliers who would actually build the route, rather than quoting a universal per-mile figure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which data center markets are hardest to get connectivity in right now?",
    answer:
      "The growth moved to secondary markets — Columbus, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, Reno, and Alberta among them — and those are exactly the markets where carrier density is thinnest. Metro dark fiber remains concentrated in Northern Virginia, Silicon Valley, Chicago, and Dallas, so a site in a boom market often has far fewer suppliers who can actually serve it. In those markets the regional fiber providers matter most, and a broker who can quote them — not just the national names — is the difference between a competitive process and a single take-it-or-leave-it bid.",
  },
  {
    question: "When in a data center build should connectivity be sourced?",
    answer:
      "Earlier than feels necessary, in three stages. At site selection, fiber proximity should be a go/no-go screen alongside power — a bad lateral can kill a site's economics before ground breaks. During construction, laterals and dark fiber should be ordered, because permitting and outside-plant construction commonly run 6 to 18 months and must land before ready-for-service. At commissioning, waves, transit, and cross-connects come online. Teams that start connectivity at commissioning instead of site selection are the ones who discover a multimillion-dollar lateral after construction milestones are locked.",
